## No more struggle with data

- Received missing weather data and plugged them into our old dataset
- But data was inconsistent
- ???


- Decided to take data from two stations with 
    - Continuous measurements
    - Representative elevation
- Now every council has the same weather data per year for the whole life cycle of the shot chamois


- Now we have 2679 observations of 82 predictors

## Data exploration

- Continuing exploring the data
-
